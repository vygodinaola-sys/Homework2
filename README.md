# Homework2 – HTML & CSS Layouts (Plain CSS, Flexbox, Bootstrap)

## 📌 Project Description
This project was created as part of **Homework 2** and focuses on building responsive web layouts using **HTML and CSS** under specific constraints.

The main goal of the assignment was to implement the same layout using **three different approaches**, while following strict rules regarding CSS usage and responsiveness.

## 🧩 Assignment Requirements

### Part A – Layout Implementation
- Create the layout **only with HTML and CSS-Plain**
- ❌ No Bootstrap
- ❌ No Flexbox
- ❌ No Grid
- Use **width-based CSS only**
- Implement **responsive design** using **media queries**
- Breakpoint: **750px**
  - Below 750px, all blocks are stacked vertically (one under another)

---

### Part B – Using GitHub Copilot
Using **Visual Studio Code + GitHub Copilot**, recreate the same layout in **three different ways**:
1. **CSS-Plain**
2. **Flexbox**
3. **Bootstrap**

> ⚠️ Important note from the assignment:  
> The solution does not have to be 100% generated by Copilot.  
> It is allowed (and expected) to make fixes and improvements manually.

### Part C – Explanation Video
Each student must record a **3–5 minute video** explaining:
- Which part they implemented
- What the final result is
- Differences between the required solution and the one generated by AI
- Whether the AI solution was fully used or modified
